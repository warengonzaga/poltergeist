  **The ghost that keeps your builds fresh** 👻  
  A universal file watcher with auto-rebuild for any language or build system
</div>

Poltergeist is an AI-friendly universal file-watcher that auto-detects any project and rebuilds them as soon as a file has been changed. Think `pnpm run dev` for native apps, with automatic configuration, notifications and a smart build queue. It stands on the shoulders of [giants](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) and fills the glue layer that's been missing.

Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Available as a standalone binary (no Node.js required) or npm package.

> **📖 Read the story behind Poltergeist**: [The Ghost That Keeps Your Builds Fresh](https://steipete.me/posts/2025/poltergeist-ghost-keeps-builds-fresh) - Learn how this tool was built using Claude Code and why it's designed to accelerate both human and AI development workflows.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS, ARM64)

```bash
brew tap steipete/tap
brew install steipete/tap/poltergeist
```

### npm (all platforms)

```bash
npm install -g @steipete/poltergeist
```

### Requirements

Poltergeist requires [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) to be installed:
  - **macOS**: `brew install watchman`
  - **Linux**: [Installation guide](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#linux)
  - **Windows**: [Chocolatey package](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#windows) or manual install

Poltergeist offers both a **CLI tool** for universal development and a **native macOS app** for enhanced monitoring (coming soon).

## Features

- **Universal Target System**: Support for anything you can build - executables, app bundles, libraries, frameworks, tests, Docker containers, ...
- **Smart Execution Wrapper**: `polter` command that waits for a build to complete, then starts it
- **Real-time Build Output**: See build progress as it happens, no more waiting in the dark
- **Inline Error Diagnostics**: Build errors shown immediately with context and actionable suggestions
- **Manual Build Command**: Trigger builds explicitly with `poltergeist build [target]`
- **Automatic Recovery**: Recent build failures trigger automatic rebuild attempts
- **Efficient File Watching**: Powered by Facebook's Watchman with smart exclusions and performance optimization
- **Intelligent Build Prioritization**: Having multiple projects that share code? Poltergeist will compile the right one first, based on which files you edited in the past
- **Automatic Project Configuration**: Just type `poltergeist init` and it'll parse your folder and set up the config.
- **Native Notifications**: System notifications with customizable sounds and icon for build status
- **Concurrent Build Protection**: Intelligent locking prevents overlapping builds
- **Advanced State Management**: Process tracking, build history, and heartbeat monitoring
- **Automatic Configuration Reloading**: Changes to `poltergeist.config.json` are detected and applied without manual restart

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @steipete/poltergeist
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Automatic Configuration** - Let Poltergeist analyze your project:

```bash
poltergeist init
```

For CMake projects you can opt out of auto-configuring a build directory:

```bash
poltergeist init --cmake --cmake-no-configure
```

This preserves existing build trees and avoids running `cmake -B` automatically; targets are still detected from `CMakeLists.txt` and any existing build directory.

If a build directory already exists (e.g. `build/CMakeCache.txt`), Poltergeist will read it to infer the generator and targets without reconfiguring.

This automatically detects your project type (Swift, Node.js, Rust, Python, CMake, etc.) and creates an optimized configuration.

2. **Start Watching** - Begin auto-building on file changes:

```bash
poltergeist haunt             # Runs as background daemon (default)
poltergeist status            # Check what's running
poltergeist status --verbose  # Show detailed status with build stats
```


3. **Execute Fresh Builds** - Use `polter` to ensure you never run stale code:

```bash
polter my-app            # Waits for build, then runs fresh binary
polter my-app --help     # All arguments passed through
```

That's it! Poltergeist now watches your files and rebuilds automatically.

Each project gets its own background process, but `poltergeist status` shows everything through a shared state system in `/tmp/poltergeist/`. One project crashing never affects others.

### Live Status Panel

Need a full-screen dashboard? Run `poltergeist status panel` (or `poltergeist panel`) to launch the Ink-based status panel. It keeps targets, git metrics, and log tails visible, plus:

- **Adaptive git summaries**: Poltergeist polls `git status`/`git diff` every 5 s and either lists dirty files or—when `--git-mode ai` or `POLTERGEIST_GIT_MODE=ai` is set—shows a Claude-generated summary of the most important diffs.
- **Status scripts**: Each project can list lightweight health checks under `statusScripts`. Peekaboo, for example, prints `SwiftLint: 0 errors / 0 warnings [31s]` under the `peekaboo` target so you can spot lint regressions instantly.
- **Post-build tests**: Targets can declare `postBuild` commands that run automatically after a successful build; the panel renders their summaries (for example `Swift tests: success [2m]`) as second lines under the target.
- **Log-aware layout**: Selecting a target scrolls its log tail into view and the controls bar stays pinned to the last row, keeping the terminal clean.

See [docs/panel.md](docs/panel.md) for configuration details and troubleshooting tips (this is the status panel tracker the team keeps up-to-date).

## Hot Reload for Apps

Poltergeist can power hot-reload loops for native apps, backends, and hybrid workspaces. The daemon handles rebuilds while `polter` relaunches binaries only after they are fresh.

1. **Auto-detect your build targets**
   ```bash
   poltergeist init --auto
   ```
   Review the generated `poltergeist.config.json`. For app bundles or servers, ensure the target’s `buildCommand` compiles your artifact and the `outputPath` points at the produced binary or bundle root.

2. **Keep the daemon running**
   ```bash
   poltergeist haunt
   ```
   The watcher streams filesystem changes to Watchman, debounces noisy saves, and queues builds smartly across multiple targets.

3. **Launch through `polter`**
   ```bash
   polter my-app --some-flag
   ```
   `polter` waits for the daemon to finish rebuilding, then execs the binary. Rerun the command whenever you want to relaunch; builds that finish while the app is running are immediately available.

4. **Wire into app-specific reload hooks (optional)**
   - Swift/Xcode: enable a target that builds your `.app` bundle, then use scripts or plugins that monitor the bundle for relaunch.
   - Electron/Web backends: chain commands (e.g., `buildCommand: "pnpm build && touch tmp/restart.txt"`) so your framework’s watcher restarts automatically.
   - Mobile simulators or embedded devices: point `outputPath` at the packaged artifact and use post-build scripts to deploy.

Configuration tips:
- Tune `settlingDelay` and `debounceInterval` per target to avoid double rebuilds for large asset drops.
- Inject environment variables under the target’s `environment` block (e.g., `SWIFT_HOT_RELOAD=1`) so your app enables its live-update code paths.
- Add multiple enabled targets (UI, backend, integration tests). Poltergeist applies per-target priorities and rebuilds whichever a change touches first.

## Designed for Humans and Agents

Poltergeist rebuilds in the background from the moment files change, so humans and coding agents can rely on `polter <target>` to run fresh binaries without bespoke scripting. Aliases (`start`/`haunt`), fuzzy target matching, and inline error reporting keep command usage predictable. For detailed agent playbooks, timeout strategies, and log streaming tips, see [docs/agent-workflows.md](docs/agent-workflows.md).
